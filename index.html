		<h1>The Underlay</h1>
		<div class="authors">Danny Hillis, SJ Klein, Travis Rich</div>
		<p>The Underlay is a global, decentralized graph database of publicly available knowledge that will make the structured knowledge of humanity available for the creation of analysis and tools. The Underlay is decentralized and hosted by a network of cooperating institutions (MIT and Harvard initially) and individuals such that no single group can control the content. The creation of the Underlay is the first attempt to replicate the rich, diverse knowledge graphs owned by private organizations in a public, decentralized manner.</p>
 
		<h2>Rationale</h2>
		<p>Technology has vastly expanded the rate of knowledge creation and dissemination. That gives us access to more knowledge from more sources, but it also makes the job of discovering and assessing it more difficult. The prevalence of false beliefs, decisions based on bad or incomplete information, distrust in science and journalism, misinformation campaigns and deliberate fraud, provide evidence that our system for sharing and judging knowledge is no longer sufficient. Importantly, most knowledge aggregation tools are owned privately and not available for public use (e.g. Google Knowledge Graph, Wolfram Alpha, Web of Science). As machines become smarter, the creation of richer collections of machine-readable knowledge is inevitable. What is not inevitable is whether they will be proprietary assets of commercial enterprises or a public resource, freely available to all.</p>

		<h2>Technical Description</h2>
		<p>The Underlay is not a storage of facts, but rather declarations of truth, along with citations of who made them and where. For example, it does not contain the assertion that “Plato was a student of Socrates”, but rather that “Plato was a student of Socrates, according to Prof. Meinwal’s article in Encyclopedia Britannica, published May 27, 1999.” It also includes other citations of other sources that state the same relationship. It does not store this information as English sentences, but in a language-independent machine-readable form that represents the relationships between the various entities involved: Plato, Socrates, Prof. Meinwal, Encyclopedia Britannica and the publication date. It will also store information about how these entities are related to other entities. Through such chains of relationships, even simple assertions are interconnected. The Underlay will at times record conflicting assertions, and then leave it to other processes to decide which source to trust. Most knowledge is uncontested, and the Underlay provides a place to find it, but it also provides a way to discover the assertions that are contested or contradictory, to weigh their credibility, and to judge their truth.</p>

		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>The Underlay and it’s team will build the protocols, instantiations, and governing rules that will enable a publicly-owned, decentralized knowledge graph. The Underlay is named as such because the specific pathway for filling the Underlay with content comes through the creation of targeted, value-adding ‘overlays’. An overlay is the presentation of some set of data that exists in the Underlay. One example overlay could look like Google Maps, where a diversity of information (restaurant locations, satellite imagery, map coordinates, etc) are fused into one highly-interactive interface. We currently seek funding partners to help us grow our capacity over the coming years as we create an Underlay consortium which will eventually lead the governance of the protocol and be funded through participating members.</p>
